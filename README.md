# Habit Tracker
Habits, good and bad, are an integral part of everyone's lifes. Unfortunately most bad habits go unnoticed in our everyday lifes, until they have 
already consolidated their positions. Good habits share the opposite fate, often feeling like chores to forget, until they've been integrated fully.

Resolving this imbalance is what habit tracking applications, like this one, are designed for.

This habit tracking application is part of a project for the course *DLBDSOOFPP01*.
